## 🎯 Project Overview

Climate change is making extreme heat events more frequent and more severe. This project examines the human cost of rising temperatures by analyzing how heat waves affect hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and mortality rates across different U.S. regions and demographic groups.

### Research Questions

1. *Temporal Trends*: How have extreme heat events evolved across U.S. regions from 2000 to 2023?

2. *Health Impact*: Is there a measurable relationship between heat events and adverse health outcomes?

3. *Vulnerable Populations*: Which age groups and demographic groups face the highest risk from extreme heat?

## 📊 Datasets

All data is sourced from the *[CDC Environmental Public Health Tracking Network](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/DataExplorer/)*. We utilize four interconnected datasets covering heat and health-related illness metrics.

*Focus*: Historical temperature extremes at county level

*Configuration*:

- *Measure*: Annual Number of Extreme Heat Events (Full Year)

- *Geography*: National by County

- *Time Period*: 2000-2023

- *Heat Metric*: Daily Maximum Temperature

- *Parameters*:
  - Minimum Duration: 2 Days
  - Absolute Threshold: 100°F
